### Hi there 👋

🧑‍💻

I’m Denis, a programmer living in 🇷🇴 Romania. I’m passionate about cloud computing 
and software development ✨.

During my day to day work I develop software in Python, Go, JavaScript and sometimes Java. 🪛

I have worked on CLIs, microservices, back-end web applications, 
Restful APIs, gRPC APIs, Apache Flink jobs and single page web applications with Vue.JS.

Kubernetes is also a technology I enjoy working with.
I’ve configured a microk8s Kubernetes cluster and deployed 
my applications along with their dependencies, which I manage using helm and Kubernetes operators. 🚀


At home I use Linux & Windows and at the job 
I currently use a MacOS system, previously I’ve used Linux. 👾

I like writing tests and documentation for the stuff I’m building 😄.

You can reach me on 📫 [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/denisnutiu/).

I also run a personal blog on https://nuculabs.dev (this blog) in which I write various technical posts 💬.
