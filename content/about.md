### Hi there 👋

🧑‍💻

I’m Denis, a programmer living in Romania. I’m passionate about cloud computing 
and software development ✨.

During my day-to-day work I am part of a small ["pizza team"](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoPizzaTeam.html) and I develop and design back-end Web APIs, font-end applications in Vue.JS and CLI tools in Python or Go. I also make architecture proposals for new or existing software components and implement them.
When required I can deploy and configure proven databases like Redis MongoDB, search engines like ElasticSearch or message brokers like Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ manually via helm charts or managed cloud solutions.

Kubernetes is my tool of choice for deploying and managing applications in the cloud. For monitoring them I use Prometheus, Loki, Grafana and OpenTelemetry.
