### Hi there 👋

🧑‍💻

I’m Denis, a programmer living in Romania. I’m passionate about cloud computing 
and software development ✨.

During my day-to-day work, I develop backend services, CLIs and web applications in Python, Go and other languages
depending on the project.

Kubernetes is my tool of choice for deploying and managing applications in the cloud.
