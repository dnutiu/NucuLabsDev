Hi üëã,


fzf is a command line tool that can be used to fuzzy search files, history, and command outputs. Check out the [Github](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) repository.


This is a tool that I wish I‚Äôve knew about earlier in my career, and for this reason I decided to blog about it.

You can also set key bindings; some popular ones are:


`
CTRL-T
` ‚Äì Paste the selected files and directories onto the command-line


`
CTRL-R
` ‚Äì Paste the selected command from history onto the command-line


`
ALT-C
` ‚Äì cd into the selected directory


If you‚Äôre on Linux and want to try it, then installing it using [Git](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#using-git) is straight forward and it also sets up your shell and key bindings.


On Windows, to enable the key bindings you can install the PSFzf module by running **Install-Module PSFzf** in an admin Powershell.


Edit your $PROFILE file and add the following items:


```
Remove-PSReadlineKeyHandler 'Ctrl+r'
Remove-PSReadlineKeyHandler 'Ctrl+t'
Import-Module PSFzf
```
