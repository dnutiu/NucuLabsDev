title: PMS5003 C# Library
---
Hello everyone,


I just want to let you know that Iâ€™ve released a C# library for interfacing with the PMS5003 (Particulate Matter Sensor) via UART.


The code is available on [Github](https://github.com/dnutiu/pms5003) and the package is available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PMS5003/).


If you have any feedback or need some feature into the library, please open an issue on Github.


Thank you!
