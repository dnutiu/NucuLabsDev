title: My Spring Boot notes
---
Lately I’ve been busy with university, work and learning something new. I’ve started my programming journey when I was in high school with Python, I didn’t have any informatics classes so I had to study on my own. I confess that I didn’t really understood how Python works, until I’ve tried Java. Python had a dynamic type system and it was very confusing for a newbie like me.


After finishing [Introduction to Computing with Java](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computing-java-hkustx-comp102x) course from HKUST on edX I started to get a better grasp on programming. After that I’ve started reading some java books like: Effective Java, Head First Java and some chapters from Intro to **Java Programming, Comprehensive Version**, which I consider to be the most complete and useful Java book ever made (if you do the exercises). Then I’ve abandoned Java because all I knew to do with it was console programs, I had no ideas about framework and all the possibilities, when I saw someone at Google giving a talk and demonstrating a browser game that ran Java in the backend I was like: “What is this magic?!”, back then I had no knowledge about networking and client-server architecture.


I’ve been doing Django lately and decided to learn something new: Spring Boot.


As I just finished the Spring Boot courses, I want to make my notes publicly available. The notes are not perfect and they have been written in a style that’s tailored for my own personal use, sorry if you don’t understand them :/.


The next steps are to write a simple pastebin clone in spring boot and to start a the spring microservices course.


The notes can be downloaded by following this link: [SpringNotes-01](/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/springnotes-01.pdf "SpringNotes-01")
