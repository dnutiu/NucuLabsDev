title: Method Injection and Property Injection Design Patterns
---
Hello,


In this article weâ€™re going to explore the Method Injection and Property Injection design patterns.


To demonstrate the patterns Iâ€™m going to add a new interface named Encoder to the printer.py file and a concrete implementation for two encoders: Rot13Encoder and NullEncoder.


```
class Encoder(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
    def encode(self, message: Message) -> Message:
        raise NotImplementedError("encode must be implemented!")


class Rot13Encoder(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
    def encode(self, message: Message) -> Message:
        return Message(codecs.encode(str(message), 'rot_13'))


class NullEncoder(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
    def encode(self, message: Message) -> Message:
        return message
```


The Encoder will be used by the printer in order to encode the messages before printing them.


## Method Injection


The method injection pattern is used as an alternative to the constructor injection when the dependency is optional or is only used in one spot, so it wouldnâ€™t make sense to inject it in the constructor.


My console printer would look like this If Iâ€™d use this pattern:


```
class ConsolePrinter(Printer):
    def __init__(self, prefix: str):
        self._prefix = prefix

    def print(self, message: Message, encoder: Encoder):
        print(self._prefix, encoder.encode(message))
```


When the application.py would call Printer.print it would pass the Encoder as a dependency.


## Property Injection


The property injection patter is mostly used in libraries, applications should avoid it. To use the property injection pattern I would have to modify the ConsolePrinter class like so:


```
class ConsolePrinter(Printer):
    def __init__(self, prefix: str):
        self._prefix = prefix
        self.encoder = NullEncoder()

    def print(self, message: Message):
        print(self._prefix, self.encoder.encode(message))
```


I have a property called encoder which by default acts as a NullEncoder, if for some reason the user of the library needs to change it, it can do so by injecting the needed dependency in the property.
