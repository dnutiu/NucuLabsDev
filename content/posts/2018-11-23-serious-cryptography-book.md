![](/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/20181124_1844568214567016314283547.jpg)This is my first book review that I did my blog, I’m not really good at reviewing books and I’m not a native english speaker either, so bear with me and my clumsy english.


I must also say that the subject covered by the book overwhelms me, I don’t claim to be an expert on the topic and and to be honest I don’t really want to become one, reading this book has provided me with enough information in order to be able to hold a basic discussion about cryptography related topics, had I put more effort, time and thought in this book I could probably become proficient.


The book has four parts. I think the **Fundamentals** part is a must-read for any aspiring developer out there, it explains in a very simple and concise way the notions of encryption, randomness and cryptographic security. I never knew there was a thing such as secure random generator and that generating true random numbers is really hard to do.


The **Symmetric Crypto** part covers block ciphers, hash functions, stream ciphers, keyed hashing and authenticated encryption. The author explains the design of the ciphers, how they work and provides a mathematical background along with proof and fancy equations.


**Asymmetric Crypto** part is all about RSA, Diffie-Hellman, Elliptic Curves and hard problems in cryptography.


And finally, the **Applications** part contains two chapters on TLS and Quantum and Post-Quantum cryptography.


I did enjoy reading the book and felt like I’ve learned a thing or two, I definitely wasn’t waste of time even if *I didn’t understand* most of it. As the author put it:


> This book can nonetheless be intimidating, and despite its relative  
> accessibility, it requires some effort to get the most out of it. I like the  
> mountaineering analogy: the author paves the way, providing you with  
> ropes and ice axes to facilitate your work, but you make the ascent  
> yourself. Learning the concepts in this book will take an effort, but there  
> will be a reward at the end.

Jean-Philippe Aumasson – Serious Cryptography


I hope you decide to give this book a try!
