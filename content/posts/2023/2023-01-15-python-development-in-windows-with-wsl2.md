title: Python Development in Windows with WSL2

Hello,


I’ve published a new video on my YouTube channel. It’s a short tutorial on how to develop Python project on Windows by setting the remote interpreter from Pycharm to use a WSL2 Python interpreter or by running Pycharm directly in WSL2.[](https://www.youtube.com/@nuculabs)
