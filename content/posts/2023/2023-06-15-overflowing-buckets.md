Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹,

Today I want to share with you a problem I've encountered along my journey.

The problem is fairly simple:

- You have a finite number of water units.
- You have a finite number of buckets.
- You need to distribute the water units into the buckets.
- Each bucket has a maximum capacity.
- When a bucket is full, the water overflows into the next two buckets by splitting evenly.
- You need to print the number of the buckets that are full.

The following diagram illustrates the problem:

If you would like to attempt to solve the problem by yourself please stop reading here. 
And try it ðŸ˜„.

Below you can find my Python solution to the problem.

```python
# TODO: I have this on my Linux machine. Need to recover it.
```

Of course my solution is not perfect, but if you have any suggestions please let me know.

I hope you enjoyed this post and I'll see you in the next one!

Thank you for reading! ðŸ“š
