Hello everyone üëã,

This is my first blog post about AI, it's a quick post on how to enable GPU support for the FastAI library.

I have avoided getting into AI for some time now, I thought that it would involve lots of complicated math, and 
I was not sure that it would be worth the effort, I did not get very good grates in my college math classes üòÖ.

In the end I've decided that I want to give it a try and I found this course [Practical Deep Learning](https://course.fast.ai/)
which is based on the book [Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527).

The main idea is that the course teaches the practical part first, with examples and then the theory, which is exactly was I was looking for and my preferred way of learning.
Imagine learning to build a simple API and you'll start by reading the [HTTP RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616), it would not be very fun (at least for me).
Every university course teaches you theory, heavy math and then you'll get a glimse of the practical part, in my opinion this doesn't work very well.
The world is moving fast and we can build stuff on the shoulders of giants, just like we use a web framework to build a web app, we can use a library to build AI applications.

In the first lesson of the course you'll build a simple image classifier that can identify which image contains a **cat** üêà‚Äç‚¨õ.
