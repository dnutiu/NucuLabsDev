Hello there ðŸ‘‹,

This is a showcase of a project I've been working on for the past weeks. It's a simple cross-platform
desktop application that allows you to tag images using a machine learning model that I've trained.

It is written in C# using Avalonia UI, and it uses the FastAI library for the machine learning part, the model is then
converted to ONNX.

The application is available for Windows, Linux and MacOS.

You can find the source code on [Github](https://github.com/dnutiu/image-tagging).

Thanks for reading!
