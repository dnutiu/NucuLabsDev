Hello üëã


I‚Äôm a software developer by profession but I also enjoy photography, this is my first blog post related to photography, here are some photos I took with the Canon R6 and the EF 15-35mm F4L lens in Timisoara train station.


I‚Äôve taken the photos underexposed at 1/60, 6400 ISO and F4. It was a cold and rainy night and I couldn‚Äôt focus well on taking photos because I was waiting for the train.
