title: Practical Binary Analysis &#8211; Crackme Walkthrough &#8211; Level 2
---
Iâ€™ve recently finished reading a book called Practical Binary Analysis which I consider a state of the art book (review will come soon) and I would like to post my solution to the crackme found in chapter 5.


> 1\. A New CTF ChallengeComplete the new CTF challenge unlocked by the oracle program!You can complete the entire challenge using only the tools discussedin this chapter and what you learned in Chapter 2. After completingthe challenge, donâ€™t forget to give the flag you found to the oracle tounlock the next challenge


To do the crackme and view the code covered in the book you donâ€™t have buy it, you can download it for free from the official website. If youâ€™re not on a Linux host system, I recommend downloading the VM which comes with the book from here: 


In chapter 5 the author analyzes the first level of the crackme using only Linux tools and explaining every step in detail, I will move past the first level and go straight to level 2.


Letâ€™s get started, download the code or the VM and navigate to the chapter5 directory if you donâ€™t see the **lvl2** binary you can unlock it by executing the following command in the terminal:


```
./oracle 84b34c124b2ba5ca224af8e33b077e9e
```


Letâ€™s letâ€™s see whatâ€™s this binary is all about, we can identify that itâ€™s an elf binary with the file command. Knowing that itâ€™s an elf, can can do a **readelf -a lvl2 > lvl2\_readelf.txt** on it, which gives us the following output:


```
ELF Header:
  Magic:   7f 45 4c 46 02 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 
  Class:                             ELF64
  Data:                              2's complement, little endian
  Version:                           1 (current)
  OS/ABI:                            UNIX - System V
  ABI Version:                       0
  Type:                              EXEC (Executable file)
  Machine:                           Advanced Micro Devices X86-64
  Version:                           0x1
  Entry point address:               0x400540 <- this is what we need.
  Start of program headers:          64 (bytes into file)
  Start of section headers:          4624 (bytes into file)
  Flags:                             0x0
  Size of this header:               64 (bytes)
  Size of program headers:           56 (bytes)
  Number of program headers:         9
  Size of section headers:           64 (bytes)
  Number of section headers:         29
  Section header string table index: 28
  ...
```


If we run the binary we just get a random byte on the screen, letâ€™s open gdb and set a breakpoint to the entry point address by typing the following commands:


```
gdb lvl2
b * 0x400540 
r # To run the program. It will now stop at the breakpoint we set.
set disassembly-flavor intel # To show the disassembly in intel syntax.
disassemble # Under normal circumstances this would show us the disassembly
# In this case it doesn't work, we can view the instruction on which we are 
# by using x/i $pc. $pc is the program counter register.
x/i $pc
# => 0x400540:	xor    ebp,ebp
display/i $pc # This makes GDB automatically display the next instruction to be executed, each time your program stops.
si step instruction
si
si
...
q # This doesn't seem to work, let's quit and see what else can we do.
```


If we do a **ltrace ./lvl2** we can see the library calls the program does:


```
__libc_start_main(0x400500, 1, 0x7fff5c6b0ec8, 0x400640 <unfinished ...>
time(0)                                                      = 1543667140
srand(0x5c027dc4, 0x7fff5c6b0ec8, 0x7fff5c6b0ed8, 0)         = 0
rand(0x7ff89538f620, 0x7fff5c6b0dac, 0x7ff89538f0a4, 0x7ff89538f11c) = 0x6e66a24a
puts("d6"d6)                                                   = 3
+++ exited (status 0) +++
```


If we google for **\_\_libc\_start\_main(**) weâ€™ll find that:


```
int __libc_start_main(int *(main) (int, char * *, char * *), int argc, char * * ubp_av, void (*init) (void), void (*fini) (void), void (*rtld_fini) (void), void (* stack_end));
```


> The \_\_libc\_start\_main() function shall initialize the process, call the *main* function with appropriate arguments, and handle the return from main().
> 
> 
http://refspecs.linuxbase.org/LSB\_3.0.0/LSB-PDA/LSB-PDA/baselibâ€”libc-start-main-.html  
> 


Which means the first address is the pointer to the main function. From our ltrace call we have: **0x400500**


If we disassemble the binary with lvl2 with: **objdump -d -M intel lvl2 > lvl2\_dasm.txt** we can see that the address weâ€™re hunting is at the beginning of the .text section.


```
 0000000000400500 <.text>:
  400500:	48 83 ec 08          	sub    rsp,0x8

  400524:	48 8b 3c c5 60 10 60 	mov    rdi,QWORD PTR [rax*8+0x601060]
  40052b:	00 
  40052c:	e8 6f ff ff ff       	call   4004a0 <puts@plt>
  400531:	31 c0                	xor    eax,eax
  400533:	48 83 c4 08          	add    rsp,0x8
  400537:	c3                   	ret    
  400538:	0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 	nop    DWORD PTR [rax+rax*1+0x0]
  40053f:	00 
```


What does the binary do? It does a srand(time(0)) and calls rand(), does some computation and prints something from **QWORD PTR \[rax\*8+0x601060\]** if we go back to the debugger or look at the readelf output again we can identify that **0x601060** is not far from the .data section which starts at **0x601040**. If we dump the section we get the following:


```
binary@binary-VirtualBox:~/code/chapter5$ objdump -s --section .data lvl2

lvl2:     file format elf64-x86-64

Contents of section .data:

```


This section looks like itâ€™s containing pointers to something followed by a null: **ca064000 00000000**. The address **ca064000** is in little endian, to make it in big endian we rewrite it as: **004006ca** which is an address that is closed to the .rodata section. Letâ€™s dump it:


\[16\] .rodata PROGBITS **00000000004006c0**  000006c0 0000000000000034 0000000000000000 A 0 0 4

And this is most likely the flag weâ€™re searching for. Thanks for reading ðŸ˜€
