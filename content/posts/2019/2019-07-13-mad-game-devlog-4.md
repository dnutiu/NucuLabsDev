Hello everyone!


I don’t have much to tell so I’m going to make it quick.


We’ve added Android build support and we’re working on setting up an internal test app on Google Play.


In order for the game to be playable on Android we’ve also added mobile controls and I got the chance to make them.


Here’s the button for placing the bomb:

To simplify our life we’ve used the CrossPlatformInput module from Unity’s standard assets package, this allows us to support PC, consoles and mobile devices with minimal code and configuration.


The current state of the game has some minor bugs with the enemies, explosions and UI, which we hope to fix soon.
