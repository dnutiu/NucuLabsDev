I haven‚Äôt done any embedded development in a while and I was thinking to build myself a remote controlled toy car with video streaming.


The project is going to take me a while. To build it I‚Äôm going to use C#. I‚Äôm already too familiar with Python and a little challenge doesn‚Äôt hurt.


To interface with the hardware, I‚Äôm going to use the [.Net Core IoT Libraries](https://github.com/dotnet/iot) from Microsoft.

My idea was to create a set of [.Net Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) services that communicate internally via [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) and an ASP.Net Core web application to control the car. (Now that I‚Äôm writing this I‚Äôm thinking that could possibly drop the web app and use gRPC directly from the client).


The client would be a desktop application that will display the video stream and data from the sensors. It should work with an Xbox controller or else it won‚Äôt be fun. üôÅ


To write it I will probably use [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/) or [Unity](https://unity.com/).

After burning the latest version of Raspbian on the board using [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) and spending a few hours in [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) developing a base for the app. I‚Äôve Installed .Net Core 3 SDK and ran the application. The results were amazing! I‚Äôve checked the thermostat in the office and it was set on 25

And the application only consumes ~10MB RAM! That‚Äôs awesome!

I‚Äôm really impressed and so far things are looking bright for `dotnet/iot`. I can‚Äôt wait to test the gRpc support and other hardware modules.


The full code can be found here: 


If you want to run the app on your Raspberry you‚Äôll need to install the .Net Core Sdk ([Instructions](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/dotnet-sdk-3.0.100-linux-arm32-binaries)) and run the following commands:


```
git clone https://github.com/dnutiu/NucuCar.git
cd NucuCar
dotnet build
cd NucuCar.Sensors
dotnet run
```

Thanks for reading!


I hope you will give `dotnet/iot` a try for your next project!
