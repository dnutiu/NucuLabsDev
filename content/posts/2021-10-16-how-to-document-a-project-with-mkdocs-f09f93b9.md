Hello,


Welcome my third video tutorial, this time, on how to get started with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).


In this video I try to give you a basic overview of MkDocs and a configuration consisting of the material theme and search plugin.

## Docker Deployment


When you‚Äôre ready to deploy your documentation website, say in Docker with Nginx the following Dockerfile and Nginx default.conf should do.


**Dockerfile**


```
FROM python:3.9 as builder

WORKDIR /app

COPY . .

RUN pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material && mkdocs build

FROM nginx as deploy

# Copy the build to the nginx directory.
COPY --from=builder /app/site/ /usr/share/nginx/html/

# Copy the nginx configuration to the nginx config directory.
COPY default.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/

EXPOSE 8080:8080/tcp
```


**default.conf**


```
server {
    listen 8080;
    root /usr/share/nginx/html/;
    index index.html;
}
```

I thought that making videos will be easier that typing blog posts but to my surprise the difficulty is a bit higher. Fixing mistakes takes more time with videos and since I‚Äôm not that great of a presenter I struggle with presenting the content. Hopefully I will improve my skills with time and practice.


Thanks for reading! üçª
