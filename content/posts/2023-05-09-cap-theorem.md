title: "CAP Theorem"
---

The CAP theorem, also known as Brewer's theorem, is a concept in distributed computing that states that it is impossible for a distributed system to simultaneously provide all three of the following guarantees:

- Consistency: All nodes in the system see the same data at the same time.
- Availability: Every request made to the system receives a response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent version of the data.
- Partition tolerance: The system continues to function despite arbitrary message loss or failure of part of the system.

In other words, when designing a distributed system, you can only choose two out of the three guarantees, and you have to sacrifice the third. This is because achieving all three is simply not possible in a distributed system.

To understand this concept better, let's take a closer look at each of the guarantees:

- Consistency: In a consistent system, all nodes see the same data at the same time. This means that if one node writes a value to the system, all other nodes will immediately see that value. However, achieving consistency requires coordination between nodes, which can cause delays and impact system performance.
- Availability: In an available system, every request made to the system receives a response, even if it may not contain the most recent version of the data. This means that the system can continue to function even if some nodes fail or are slow to respond. However, achieving availability may require sacrificing consistency, as nodes may not immediately see the most recent data.
- Partition tolerance: In a partition-tolerant system, the system continues to function despite arbitrary message loss or failure of part of the system. This means that the system can continue to operate even if some nodes are disconnected from the network. However, achieving partition tolerance may require sacrificing either consistency or availability, as the system may not be able to maintain both guarantees in the face of network partitions.

So, to summarize, the CAP theorem states that in a distributed system, you can only choose two of the three guarantees: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. You must choose the two guarantees that are most important for your specific use case, and sacrifice the third.

It's worth noting that the CAP theorem is not a hard-and-fast rule, and there are some ways to achieve some level of all three guarantees in certain situations. However, it is still a useful concept to understand when designing and building distributed systems.

I hope this explanation of the CAP theorem was helpful and informative!
