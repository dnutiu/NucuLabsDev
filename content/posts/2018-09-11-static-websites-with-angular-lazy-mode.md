title: Static websites with Angular, lazy mode.

I had to do a project for a friend and because Hugo is a nice tool yet a bit uncomfortable to use, I decided to use Angular. After finishing the website’s routes, css and images I have the project to my friend and he had a bit of a trouble deploying it on his Apache server. His host wouldn’t allow .htaccess. Q.Q


#### The solution?


Rename index.html to contact.html, team.html, project.html, objectives.html and voila! A temporary solution until the htaccess problem is solved.
