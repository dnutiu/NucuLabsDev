title: Running Linux GUI Applications in Windows

Hi üëã,


This is a quick tutorial on how to run Linux graphical interface application in Windows using X Server‚Äôs forwarding feature.


The first step is to download and install the [VcXsrv Windows X Server](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/) on your üíª Windows machine.


Then, start [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/) with the following configuration:

Ensure that VcXsrv is not blocked in Windows Firewall, it should be allowed in **Public** and **Private** networks.

You may also use more restrictive firewal settings as explained in [/wsl-windows-toolbar-launcher#firewall-rules](https://github.com/cascadium/wsl-windows-toolbar-launcher#firewall-rules).

The next step is to configure your Linux box.


I‚Äôm using Ubuntu in WSL 2.0 and pasting the following code into **~/.zshrc** or **~/.bashrc** does the trick for me. Feel free to upvote the author on [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/a/65576810/4092044).


```
# X11
HOST_IP=$(host `hostname` | grep -oP '(\s)\d+(\.\d+){3}' | tail -1 | awk '{ print $NF }' | tr -d '\r')
export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1
export DISPLAY=$HOST_IP:0.0
export NO_AT_BRIDGE=1
export PULSE_SERVER=tcp:$HOST_IP
```


After that‚Äôs done, if VcXsrv is running, you should be able to open Linux GUI apps from your Terminal.
