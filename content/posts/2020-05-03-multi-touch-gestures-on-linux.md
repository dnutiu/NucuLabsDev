title: Multi Touch Gestures on Linux
---
Hello,


Iâ€™ve been using Linux full time on my work laptop and one thing that I really miss from the Macbook is the multi touch gestures. I often find myself swiping 3 fingers up the trackpad to see all my open applications and nothing happens, bummer.


Then, I came across [Fusuma](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma), a great project which aims to bring multi touch gesture support to Linux laptops!


It wonâ€™t give you an Apple like experience but itâ€™s okay-ish. I can finally swipe three fingers up to show all my open applications and three fingers left or right to switch between my gnome workspaces, and it comes with some plugins which allow you to create a personalized touchpad experience, for example, tap 3 fingers at the same time and shutdown the computer. Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯


To install and use Fusuma please follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma#1-grant-permission-to-read-the-touchpad-device) from the Github repo. ðŸ™‚


Bellow, is my Fusuma config file:
