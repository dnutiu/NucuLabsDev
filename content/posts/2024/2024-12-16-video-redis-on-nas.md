title: How to install Redis on Synology NAS (Container Manager)

Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I run a small set of containers on my NAS at Home to monitor different weather and run automations. Because of this I
wanted to install Redis on my NAS as well.

Redis is a key value database that has a lot of extra modules such as:

- Redis Search:  A query and indexing engine for Redis, providing secondary indexing, full-text search, vector
  similarity search and aggregations.
- Redis JSON: A NO-SQL Document Database
- Redis Graph: A graph database.
- Redis TimeSeries: A time series database.
- Redis Bloom: Bloom and Cuckoo filters implementation.
- Redis Streams: An append only Log

These functionalities save me a lot of time and improve my software running inside my home. Redis is also a simple
service to deploy and maintain.

So I made a quick tutorial on how to install [Redis](https://redis.io/) on
a [Synology NAS](https://www.synology.com/en-global)
using the Container Manager.
