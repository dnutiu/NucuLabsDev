Hello everyone, üëã

This is my first post of 2024, and ever since I've started the blog in ~2018, I've had
engineering ` Programming, Cloud and Engineering! üë®‚Äçüî¨;`
in the blog's description. üòÑ

I made a few posts related to "engineering" other than Software Engineering. In 2018, I was still studying computer
science and engineering at UPT, and I was fascinated by the Electrical Engineering courses. I figured that I'd write
blog posts about circuit analysis techniques such as Ohm's Law, Th√©venin‚Äôs Theorem, Mesh Analysis, and so on.

Unfortunately, I did not write them and focused solely on Software Engineering and a few posts
on [Embedded](/categories/embedded/).

I hope to make this post a bit more thematic to the engineering side by talking about my experience with 3D printing and
CAD programs.

I've got my first 3D printer [Bambu Lab A1](https://bambulab.com/en/a1) a week ago, and I was hooked on it!

As a beginner, I successfully printed:

- Ice Scrapper
- Cutlery Holder
- Raspberry PI case
- Phone Holder

While also modeling two objects by myself, a box for my audio interface so that I can hide it under my desk and a box
that holds the Raspberry Pi case, printed previously.

If you plan on buying a 3D printer yourself, you can find lots of models on websites such as:

- [https://www.printables.com/](https://www.printables.com/)
- [https://makerworld.com/en](https://makerworld.com/en)

The printer is intuitive to use. I got my first print withing minutes after the initial setup and calibrations.

You don't need to perform manual calibration since the printer can self-calibrate before every print. On the first run,
it will do a more thorough calibration.

Other than that, you will need to perform monthly or weekly maintenance, which is well documented on
Bambu Lab's [website](https://wiki.bambulab.com/en/a1/maintenance).

The printer software runs on all the major platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux and Android. You can print everything from
your phone with less tweaking because the printer is connected to your Wi-Fi network.

To model objects...
