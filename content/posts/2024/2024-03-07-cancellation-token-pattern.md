Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I wanted to write this article for a while now but I've postponed it. The Cancellation Token Pattern article is a pattern
that is inspired by C#'s [CancellationToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.cancellationtoen?view=net-8.0) struct and Golang's
[context](https://pkg.go.dev/context) package.

The main idea of the pattern is to **allow the user of an API** to cancel its operations, but in order 
for this pattern to work the API must be written with a cancellation token in mind.
