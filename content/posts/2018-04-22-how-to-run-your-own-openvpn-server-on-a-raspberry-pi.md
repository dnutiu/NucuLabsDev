My Raspberry, serving as an OpenVPN server
Hello everyone!


In this short article I will explain how to setup your own VPN (Virtual Private Network) server on a Raspberry PI with OpenVPN. After we setup the server, we will setup an obfuscation server in order to disguise our traffic indicating that we‚Äôre using a VPN. This will help us evade some form of censorship.


### Why use a VPN?


First, let‚Äôs talk about why you may want to use a VPN server:


1. Avoid man in the middle attacks. If you have a malicious user on your local network ‚Äî even your roommate ‚Äî that person is able to monitor your unencrypted traffic and tamper with it.
2. Hide your internet activity from your ISP (Internet Service Provider) or University, in my case.
3. Unblock services. My University blocks all UDP (User Datagram Protocol) packets. This means that I cannot use any application that communicates via UDP. I can‚Äôt use my email client, play games, or even use Git!


I decided to setup a VPN on my home internet using a Raspberry Pi. This way I can connect to my home network while I‚Äôm at the University. If you need a VPN server in another country, you can buy a 5$/month virtual private server from many hosting providers.


### Installing OpenVPN


This step is really easy, because we will use a shell script to do it for you. So you just have to ‚Äúpress‚Äù next and finish.


The installation will take a long time, depending on the key-size you chose. On my Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, it took about 3 hours.


Please go this repository and then follow the instructions




If you don‚Äôt know the IP address of your server, just put `0.0.0.0` . I‚Äôve chosen `443` for the port and **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol) for the protocol.


**Note**: This is very important because my university only allows **TCP/80** and **TCP/443** ports, the rest are pretty much blocked. Also Obfsproxy only works with TCP, so make sure you chose **TCP**!


After the script has finished, you‚Äôll get an **.ovpn** file. It can be imported in your favourite VPN client, and everything should work out of the box.


#### Testing the connection


Import the .ovpn file in your VPN client and change the ip `0.0.0.0` to the local ip of your Raspberry PI. Depending on your network configuration it may be of the form`192.168.*.*` .


*Note: This will only work if you are connected to the same WiFi as the Pi is.*

**I‚Äôve configured my router so the PI always gets a reserved IP address. You may have to check out your router settings if you want to do something similar.**


If the connection is successful, congratulations, you now have a VPN server! But, you cannot access it from outside‚Ä¶ yet.


If you only want an OpenVPN server without the obfuscation proxy, then you can skip to **Port Forwarding**.


### Obfuscation **Proxy Install**


Obfs4 is a scrambling proxy. It disguises your internet traffic to look like noise. Somebody who snoops on your traffic won‚Äôt actually know what you‚Äôre doing, and it will protect you from active probing attacks which are used by the Great Firewall of China.


*Note: This method won‚Äôt work if your adversary allows only whitelisted traffic üôÅ*


#### Let‚Äôs install the proxy server now.


0\. Install the required package:


```
apt-get update && apt-get install obfs4proxy
```


1. Create a directory that will hold the configuration.


`sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/tor/pt_state/obfs4`


1. Create the configuration file.


`sudo nano /var/lib/tor/pt_state/obfs4/obfs4.config`


In the configuration file, you will paste the following things:


```
TOR_PT_MANAGED_TRANSPORT_VER=1
TOR_PT_STATE_LOCATION=/var/lib/tor/pt_state/obfs4
TOR_PT_SERVER_TRANSPORTS=obfs4
TOR_PT_SERVER_BINDADDR=obfs4-0.0.0.0:444
TOR_PT_ORPORT=127.0.0.1:443
```


**TOR\_PT\_SERVER\_BINDADDR** is the address on which the proxy will listen for new connections. In my case it is it `0.0.0.0:444` ‚Äî why 444 and not 443? Well, because I don‚Äôt want to change the OpenVPN server configuration which is currently listening on 443. Also, I will map this address later to 443 using Port Forwarding.


**TOR\_PT\_ORPORT** should point to the OpenVPN server. In my case, my server runs on `127.0.0.1:443`


1. Create a SystemD service file.


```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/obfs4proxy.service
```


Then paste the following contents into it:


```
[Unit]
Description=Obfsproxy Server
```


\[Service\]  
EnvironmentFile=/var/lib/tor/pt\_state/obfs4/obfs4.config  
ExecStart=/usr/bin/obfs4proxy -enableLogging true -logLevelStr INFO


\[Install\]  
WantedBy=multi-user.target


1. Start the Obfuscation proxy.


Now, make sure that OpenVPN is running and run the following commands in order to start the proxy and enable it to start on boot.


```
sudo systemctl start ```
obfs4proxy
sudo systemctl enable obfs4proxy
```
```

1. Save the cert KEY

After the service has started, run the following command and save the cert KEY.

`cat /var/lib/tor/pt_state/obfs4/obfs4_bridgeline.txt`

The key is of the form `Bridge obfs4 :  cert=<strong>KEY</strong> iat-mode=0` . You will need it when you‚Äôre connecting to the VPN.

1. Testing the connections.

Open up your VPN client and change the ip from 443 to 444 in order to connect to the proxy instead of the OpenVPN server.

After that, find the Pluggable Transport option in your OpenVPN client and see if it supports **obfs4**.

Congratulations! Only a few more things to tweak before using this VPN from the outside world.

### **Port Forwarding**

In order to access the OpenVPN server from the outside world we need to unblock the ports, because they are most likely blocked. As you remember, I have reserved my PI‚Äôs IP address on my router to always be `192.168.1.125` so it doesn‚Äôt change if the PI disconnects or if the router reboots.

This way I have defined the following rules in my Port Forwarding table:

<figure class="wp-caption">![](/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/8b6f8-1brxo0rgpbzewvp0kf4xndw.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">TL-WR841N‚Äôs Port Forwarding settings page.</figcaption></figure>The outside port **443** will point to the obfuscation‚Äôs server port **444.** If you don‚Äôt have an obfuscation server, then leave **443-&gt;443.**

The port 25 will point to the PI‚Äôs SSH port 22. This is only for my own convenience.

In case I want to access the OpenVPN server directly without the obfuscation proxy, I have created a rule **444-&gt;443**

The service port is the **OUTSIDE** port that will be used with your **PUBLIC** IP address. To find your public IP, use a service like whatsmyip.com.

The internal port is the **INSIDE** port. It can be used only when you are connected to the network.

*Note: The first rule is saying redirect all the connections from* ***PUBLIC\_IP:443*** *to* ***192.168.1.125:444***

#### Testing

1. Find your public IP and replace your old IP with the public IP in the .ovpn file or in the VPN client.
2. Connect to the VPN.

That‚Äôs it.

### **Dynamic DNS**

In most cases, your IP will change because it‚Äôs a dynamic IP. A way to overcome this is to create a small program on the PI that saves your IP and sends you an email every day or so. You may also store the IP in an online database such as Firebase.

My router has Dynamic DNS setting. This way I can use a service provider like NoIP and get a domain like `example.no-ip.com` that will always point to my public IP address.
