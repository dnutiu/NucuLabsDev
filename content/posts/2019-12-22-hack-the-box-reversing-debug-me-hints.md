Hello,


Here are some hints for solving the Debug Me challenge on HackThebox:


- Use a good debugger like [x64dbg](https://x64dbg.com/#start)
- Use an anti-anti-debugging plugin like [Scylla Hide](https://github.com/x64dbg/ScyllaHide). (read the instructions on how to install it)
- Step through the challenge and see where it takes you.


Thanks!
