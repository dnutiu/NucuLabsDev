I started reading [this book](https://nostarch.com/binary) in november and it took me about two weeks to finish it. You should be a bit comfortable Linux and programming if you plan to give it a try. Here are my thoughts about it.


What I like the most about this book is that it explains the subject in a straightforward and concise way! The author is a very knowledgeable security researcher and his work is state of the art!


The book helped me fill a lot of gaps about how binary analysis is done, code obfuscation, linear disassemblers, recursive disassemblers, intermediate languages and lots of tools and libraries. It also helped me learn things that I didnâ€™t know they exist, like: code injection, binary instrumentation, dynamic taint analysis and symbolic execution analysis.


Each chapter sets the foundation for the next one and at the end of each chapter youâ€™re invited to solve the exercises which help you enforce and understand the information. The code and examples can be found on the bookâ€™s [website](https://practicalbinaryanalysis.com/).


There werenâ€™t many books that Iâ€™ve found the appendixes very useful. This one is an exception! Thereâ€™s one appendix that guides you on further reading and one that discusses the disassemblers and tools used in the book. Being a novice in the field I just love when I get recommendation from an expert like [Dennis Andriesse](https://mistakenot.net/).


I enjoyed the book a lot and I hope you will too! ðŸ™‚
