Hi **ðŸ‘‹**,


I have recently updated the firmware of my RODE audio interface from 1.12.x to 1.13, and the device was no longer working properly on Linux, it had trouble with the microphone. I found out that it was an audio sampling issue.


```
dmesg -kH

[feb21 16:20] usb 1-9.3: 1:1: cannot set freq 44100 to ep 0x82
[  +0,005008] usb 1-9.3: 1:1: cannot set freq 44100 to ep 0x82
[  +0,005019] usb 1-9.3: 1:1: cannot set freq 44100 to ep 0x82
[  +0,004971] usb 1-9.3: 1:1: cannot set freq 44100 to ep 0x82
[  +0,015019] usb 1-9.3: 1:1: cannot set freq 44100 to ep 0x82
```


To fix it, I did the following:


1\. Edit Pulseâ€™s ðŸ“– daemon.conf.


```
nano /etc/pulse/daemon.conf
```


And add the following lines:


```
default-sample-format = s24le
default-sample-rate = 48000
alternate-sample-rate = 48000
```


2\. Disconnect the device and then kill the pulse daemon with ðŸ”ª **pulseaudio -k**.


3\. Connect back the device ðŸ”Œ, it should work without problems.


Thanks for reading and happy hacking! ðŸ¥·
