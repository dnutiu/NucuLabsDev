Hello everyone!


I’ve created my first course called “Build a Movie Tracking API with FastAPI and Python”


It will teach you to build and API from the ground up and the knowledge you will learn here will be transferable to other projects as well.


It also includes some content on:


- Docker
- Kubernetes
- MongoDB
- Validating JWT
- Middleware
- RESTFul advice
- Repository Pattern
- Metrics


If you’d like to support my work, you can access the course here. If you can’t buy it I’ll understand, please comment below and I will share a coupon code when available.
