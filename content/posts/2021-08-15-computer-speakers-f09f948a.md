Hello,


Yes, this post title is weird, but I want to take a moment to acknowledge that Iâ€™m very grateful for dad for buying these computer speakers and much more.


In ~2002 my dad bought me my first computer, and at the same time a man approached us asking if we want to buy his second-hand speakers. I was about 5-6 years old at that time and I still remember the moment.


Iâ€™m 25 years old now and these are the only computer speakers that Iâ€™ve used, they are almost 20 years old!

Thank you dad! ðŸ”‰
