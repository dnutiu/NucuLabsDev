Hi ðŸ‘‹


Have you ever tried to setup your Windowsâ€™s Remote Desktop functionality and failed with the following error message â€œ**logon attempt failed**â€œ, knowing that your credentials were correct and that youâ€™re on the same Wi-Fi network with the computer youâ€™re trying to access?


Well, I did.


Most of the solutions youâ€™ll find on other blogs make you edit your Windowâ€™s registry, network settings and so on, which in my case was not needed, and it is somehow overkill.

Logging in **with a password** and my Microsoft account on the computer I wanted to setup Remote Desktop solved the issue.


What I had to do was to go in **Settings > Accounts > Sign-in Options**, disable Windows Hello PIN and all other sign in options, setup **Password sign-in option** and then relog on my PC.

Thatâ€™s it.


## Windows 11


If youâ€™re on Windows 11 then you donâ€™t have sign in with a password as an option. What worked for me is to reset my PIN using my Microsoft account during the login screen.


After resetting my PIN the Remote Desktop started working.
