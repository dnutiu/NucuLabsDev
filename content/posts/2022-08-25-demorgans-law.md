DeMorganâ€™s law is a simple law that I learned at UPT during one of my hardware classes. While it is useful in hardware it, it is also useful when writing programs.


If you have a condition like not (`A and B)`, you can rewrite it to `!A or !B`.


```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = True
    b = True

    if not (a and b):
        print("True")
    else:
        print("False")

    if not a or not b:
        print("True")
    else:
        print("False")
```
