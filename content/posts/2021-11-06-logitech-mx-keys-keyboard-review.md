Hi,


I‚Äôm a software developer and to do my job I have to sit on the computer at least 8 hours daily. Having a decent, comfortable, and robust keyboard to do my job is a requirement. My previous keyboard was a [Razer BlackWidow V3](https://www.razer.com/gaming-keyboards/razer-blackwidow-v3). I‚Äôve used it as my daily driver for gaming and programming, but since I started recording videos the keyboard‚Äôs clicking sound was a problem and I had to replace it. (I think I‚Äôve also heard my neighbor once complain about it üòÖ)


I‚Äôve stumbled upon a [Logitech MX Key](https://www.logitech.com/en-roeu/products/keyboards/mx-keys-wireless-keyboard.html)s keyboard.


Here‚Äôs what I like about it:


- It‚Äôs nice to type on. The experience is like ThinkPad keyboards. It feels nice, unique, and premium.
- It has a white backlight that turns on when you hit a key or when it detects motion near the keyboard.
- It‚Äôs silent, like a laptop keyboard.
- It is wireless.
- It works well on Linux and on Windows, macOS too.
- It has lots of media control keys, they can be re-mapped using [Logitech Options](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/options) software.
- Battery is good. It lasts about a week of daily use with backlight on.


And now, here‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt like about it:


- You can‚Äôt use it in wired mode, it only supports wireless.
- 
Backlight settings reset when the unifying receiver loses power.
 *(At the time of editing this post, this problem went away by itself)*


That‚Äôs about it. Overall, I like it and I will stick with it.


I don‚Äôt regret getting the version with the numpad since I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to take it away from my desk, there‚Äôs a [mini version ](https://www.logitech.com/en-roeu/products/keyboards/mx-keys-mini.html)that is more portable, if you‚Äôre interested.


Thanks for taking your time to read though this post. üçª
